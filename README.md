# draw-an-overworld

what if you can scribble=draw and then generate a brave new realtime overworld?!


Scribble your world. Describe it to vividify it. Turn it into a world. 

Demo: [https://yosun.github.io/draw-an-overworld/unified-world.html](https://yosun.github.io/draw-an-overworld/unified-world.html)

(Currently we use fal nanobanana for scribble to vivid image, so have your fal api key ready.)
